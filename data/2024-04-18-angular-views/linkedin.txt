ðŸš€ **Are you struggling with making your Angular applications responsive, especially when it comes to tables?** ðŸ¤”

In my latest blog post, I've delved into a simple yet efficient approach to crafting responsive views in Angular applications, focusing particularly on the tricky challenge of responsive tables. Moving away from traditional solutions like CSS media queries or third-party libraries, I've explored the transformative pattern â€” a method that involves loading different components based on screen size, such as one for desktop and another for mobile. This approach simplifies view customization but requires maintaining similar logic across multiple components.

To tackle device detection (mobile or otherwise), I've utilized Angular CDK's `BreakpointObserver` to load the appropriate component. While CSS media queries could also perform this task, they tend to load both components and simply hide one, which isn't as efficient.

Seeking efficiency and to save those precious kilobytes, I've implemented the `@defer` block, ensuring components load only when needed. This technique not only reduces the overall size of loaded components but also optimizes page load according to the specific needs of the device â€” mobile or desktop. As a result, mobile environments load views with fewer KBs, saving data, while on desktop, the table component loads as required. This not only enhances user experience by reducing load times but also optimizes resource use, proving to be a practical solution for developing responsive Angular applications.
